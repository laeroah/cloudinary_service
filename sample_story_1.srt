00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:00,755
Did you know that

2
00:00:00,755 --> 00:00:01,740
The Great Emu War

3
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,964
took place in Australia

4
00:00:02,964 --> 00:00:05,240
in 1932? In the

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,385
rugged plains of Western

6
00:00:06,385 --> 00:00:08,113
Australia, soldiers clad in

7
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:09,618
military uniforms gathered their

8
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:12,213
weapons. Standing before them

9
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,652
were thousands of emus,

10
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:14,989
large flightless birds with

11
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:16,010
feathers as brown as

12
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,985
the earth itself. The

13
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,738
emus moved cautiously, their

14
00:00:19,738 --> 00:00:21,389
large feet creating imprints

15
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:22,346
in the dusty ground

16
00:00:22,346 --> 00:00:23,159
as they approached the

17
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:25,113
army's position. With a

18
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:26,808
commanding order, the soldiers

19
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:27,849
unleashed a barrage of

20
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:29,137
bullets, aiming to quell

21
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:31,233
the emu invasion. But

22
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:32,645
the emus, nimble and

23
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:33,912
quick, scattered in all

24
00:00:33,912 --> 00:00:35,759
directions, evading the soldiers'

25
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,567
onslaught. Undeterred, the army

26
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:40,401
persisted, launching a relentless

27
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:41,416
assault in an attempt

28
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,137
to turn the tide.

29
00:00:43,137 --> 00:00:45,172
However, despite their efforts,

30
00:00:45,172 --> 00:00:46,144
the emus proved to

31
00:00:46,144 --> 00:00:47,788
be formidable adversaries, their

32
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:51,073
numbers seemingly endless. Ultimately,

33
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:52,043
a decision was made

34
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:53,309
to withdraw the troops,

35
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:54,307
and the emus claimed

36
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:55,343
victory in what became

37
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:56,126
known as the Great

38
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:59,126
Great Emu War.
