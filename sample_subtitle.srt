00:00:00,087 --> 00:00:01,482
Did you know
that the very first

3
00:00:01,482 --> 00:00:02,799
Google Doodle
wasn't a planned

5
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,687
celebration, but
a mischievous cry

7
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:08,690
for help? Back in
1998, founders

9
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,682
Larry Page and
Sergey Brin were

11
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:11,180
heading out to
Burning Man, the

13
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,756
wild and wacky
festival in the

15
00:00:12,756 --> 00:00:15,112
Black Rock Desert.
They wanted to

17
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:16,373
let users know
they were out

19
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:17,882
of office, but
with a typical

21
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:20,904
Google twist. So,
they plopped a

23
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:22,400
stick figure
drawing of a

25
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,446
burning man
behind the Google

27
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:25,604
logo. It was
meant to be a

29
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:27,191
quick and silly
thing, but it

31
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:28,745
ended up sparking
a tradition that

33
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:30,665
now sees Doodles
grace the homepage

35
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:32,293
for everything from
major holidays

37
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:35,256
to obscure historical
figures. Who knew

39
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,754
a little Burning
Man burner could

41
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:39,534
ignite such a
creative firestorm?

43
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:41,480
So next time you
see a Doodle,

45
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,705
remember its humble
beginnings: a playful

47
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:45,280
wink from the
Google founders,

49
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,648
reminding us that
even the biggest tech giants

51
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,000
can have a bit of fun.
